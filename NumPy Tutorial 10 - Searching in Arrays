# NumPy Tutorial 10 - Searching in Arrays
# Importing relevant modules
import numpy as np

# We can search in a given array to tell whether an element
# is located in there
array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8, 9 ,9])
# Finding if a given value is in this array
location = np.where(array1 == 4)
print(location)
# This prints (array([7, 8], dtype=int64),)
# This means 4 is located at index 3 and index 4!

# You can do more than jsut locate whether an element is in
# an array
less_than_five = np.where(array1 < 5)
print(less_than_five)
# This gives (array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=int64),)
# meaning those numbers are at index 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

divisible_by_three = np.where(array1 % 3 == 0)
print(divisible_by_three)
