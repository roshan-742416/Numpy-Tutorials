# NumPy Tutorial 6 - Basic Operations on Arrays

# Importing relevant modules
import numpy as np

# We can create an array between nubers like we can do with
# lists and the "range" command
# When using arrays we use the "arange" command

one_dim = np.arange(1, 6)
print(one_dim)
# This will produce from n to n-1
two_dim = np.arange(1, 10).reshape(3, 3)
print(two_dim)
three_dim = np.arange(1, 28).reshape(3, 3, 3)
print(three_dim)

a = np.arange(1, 6)
b = np.arange(6, 11)
# a and b have same size 6-1 = 11-6 = 5 elements

# Adding
print(a + b)
# Subtracting
print(b - a)
# Square all the elements in the array 'a'
print(a**2) # This is not matrix multiplication
print(a**3)

# NumPy has its own functions built in
print(np.sqrt(a))
print(np.sqrt(b))

# Multiplying everything in 'a' by 3
print(a*3)

# testing whether values in an array are less than a given va;ue
c = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(c < 2)    # Gives an array of booleans
# [ True False False False]
